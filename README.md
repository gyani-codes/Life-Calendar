# Life Calendar

This cool idea of making life calendar is inspired from Tim Urban's Ted Talk. And Yeah you gussed it right, I am too a master procrastinator.

Each block represent a week , and there are 52 weeks in a year , so each row is a year. The filled boxes represents the weeks that I have lived and empty ones repsresent the remaining.
